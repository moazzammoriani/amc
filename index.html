            <h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
            <p>
Wonders Enterprises is the largest antimony supplier in Pakistan. Formed by two lifelong friends with nearly a decade of experience in extracting, packaging, and supplying essential minerals, our founders have used that time to become the most trusted name in the country for anything dealing with this critical natural resource. 
Our journey began with the extraction and supply of barite, followed by pumice. Soon after, we discovered the immense potential of antimony in powering the global economy, and we haven't looked back since. A highly sought-after commodity forming the backbone of many industries, our customers can rest assured they will have timely access to the highest-quality version of this scarce metal.

                    <p>
Since our inception, we have become the single biggest producer of antimony from all over Pakistan. We have leveraged this position to foster strong ties with major purchasers in the Chinese, East Asian, and Middle Eastern markets. Outside of antimony, we have worked to establish long-term partnerships with other mining companies hailing from China and the United States, including powerhouses like Iterian International Inc. Through these networks, we aim to source other essential minor and base metals so our clients can have all of their needs met solely through Wonders Enterprises.
